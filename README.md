# Day-Planner

This simple day planner lets anyone log their hourly plans from 8AM-10PM. Once the user writes in the planner, they can click the blue save icon on the right of the screen to save their input even after refreshing their page. This planner also colors in time blocks to help the user determine past, present and future plans.
